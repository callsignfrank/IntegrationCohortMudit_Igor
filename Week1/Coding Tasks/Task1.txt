Question #5

We have this endpoint:

https://735ef563-176d-431c-85ce-2cc07056ef03.mock.pstmn.io/payments/link

Here's your task:





Make an API request and verify that you are successfully receiving a response (status code 200)



Parse the response and get the IP address of the transaction.



Write your solutions in the weekly chat.

Itâ€™s similar to getting a payment link, have fun :)
